# What does this program do? 
# Extremely simple function that scans a string for repeated sub-strings.
# Developed specifically to track down repeated patterns in nucleotide strings. 

def patternCount(text, pattern):
  count = 0
  current_int = 0
  for i in text:
    if text[current_int:current_int+len(pattern)] == pattern:
      count = count + 1
    current_int = current_int+1
  return count

# Test cases:
print(patternCount("CGATATATCCATAG", "ATA"))
